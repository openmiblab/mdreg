`mdreg` is developed by the `medical imaging group <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/research/themes/imaging>`_ at the University of Sheffield, UK. 

Contact: `Steven Sourbron <https://github.com/plaresmedima>`_.

A first python implementation of model-driven registration was developed for 
use in quantitative renal MRI in the iBEAt study, and compared against 
group-wise model-free registration implemented in elastix (Tagkalakis F, et 
al. Model-based motion correction outperforms a model-free method in 
quantitative renal MRI. Abstract-1383, ISMRM 2021). 

The code base has since been rewritten from scratch. Up to version 0.3.x, 
development and deployment was funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative 
through the `BEAt-DKD project <https://www.beat-dkd.eu/>`_.

The coregistration engines for `mdreg` are `itk-elastix` and `scikit-image`.
