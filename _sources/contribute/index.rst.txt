We welcome any contributions to `mdreg` including for instance bug fixes 
or new features. At this stage we are primarily interested in expanding 
the library of :ref:`signal models <models>`.

If you would like to make a contribution, feel free to submit a 
`pull request <https://github.com/QIB-Sheffield/mdreg/pulls>`_. 

For larger contributions it is best to first 
`submit an issue <https://github.com/QIB-Sheffield/mdreg/issues>`_ so we can 
discuss and agree on a possible approach before you spend too much time on 
the implementation.
